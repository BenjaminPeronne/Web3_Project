# Web_3 Project (Digital Safe)

We want to set up a digital safe. The site will be made in PHP and HTML. On the server there are two files and a directory. We must be able to connect, create an account, upload and retrieve a file.

With the MVC model for this project.

## Connection

We use the index.html which present :
- login & password form
- link to create account (if don't have) 

The validation of the form must call on the `controller_connexion.php `

The click on the link allows to call the view `creation_compte.php`
